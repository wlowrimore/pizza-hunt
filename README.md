# Pizza Hunt

## Description

Pizza Hunt is a social media recipe app where users can create custom pizzas, add
comments to recipes, and create threads within those comments. The front-end for Pizza Hunt was
provided, and my task was to add back-end functionality to it. This app uses MongoDB, a document-based
NoSQL database, and Mongoose, an Object-Document Mapper, to work with unstructured data. IndexedDB,
a NoSQL client-side storage API in the browser, was used in this application.
